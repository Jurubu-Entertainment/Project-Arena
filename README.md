# Project-Arena
Project Arena is a game about fighting in an arena (a better name is still pending). You will be put into fights against enemies, and as you win you'll gain Fame and Victory Credits. Fame will unlock new arena fights, including ones that progress the story as well as side-fights that serve as additional challenges. In-between fights you'll be able to spend the Victory Credits you have accumulated on new equipment, new abilities and new upgrades.

During arena fights you will encounter a large variety of enemies using a multitude of weapons, abilities, attack patterns and movement patterns. The fights will take place on arenas of varying shapes and sized, and featuring a large variety of environmental hazards and powerups.

There will also be different types of fights. Some fights will pit you against waves of enemies, while other fights will pit you against arena champions who will challenge you with unique weapons and abilities.

There are also different difficulties of fights. Minor fights are small and easy, but do not grant many rewards. And after some minor fights there will be major fights, which are much harder, but provide much greater rewards. There will also be challenge fights, which will feature uniquely challenging arenas and enemy arrangements. Some challenge fights could even see the return of past arena champions armed with a new arsenal of devastating weaponry and abilities.

While most fights will allow you to set up your own loadout and use the weapons and abilities, as well as their upgrades, that you have unlocked with Victory Credits, some fights will lock you into a specific premade loadout to provide extra challenge.

Along the way you will forge alliances with various characters to help you in your journey to freedom, many of whom will help you unlock even more weapons, abilities and upgrades. There are also a wide range of sponsors who all want the opportunity to sponsor you in exchange for granting you various perks and privelages inside and outside of the arena.
