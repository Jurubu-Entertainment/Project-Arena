# Project-Arena
Project Arena is a game about fighting in an arena (a better name is still pending). You will be put into fights against groups of enemies, and as you win you'll gain Fame and Victory Credits. Fame will unlock new arena fights, including ones that progress the story as well as side-fights that serve as additional challenges. In-between fights you'll be able to spend the Victory Credits you have accumulated on new equipment, new abilities and new upgrades.

During arena fights you will encounter a large variety of enemies using a multitude of weapons, abilities, attack patterns and movement patterns. And the fights will take place on arenas of varying sizes and shapes, and featuring a variety of environmental hazards and powerups.

There will also be different types of fights. Some fights will pit you against waves of enemies, and you'll have to win all of the waves to obtain victory, while other fights will pit you against arena champions who will challenge you with unique weapons and abilities.

There are also different difficulties of fights. Minor fights are small and easy, but do not grant many rewards. And after some minor fights there will be major fights, which are much harder, but provide much greater rewards. There will also be challenge fights, which will feature uniquely challenging arenas and enemy arrangements. Some challenge fights could even see the return of past arena champions armed with a new arsenal of devastating weaponry and abilities.
